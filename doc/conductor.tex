We present in this paper an application that shows how the bluetooth technology can be used to locate a person who has a bluetooth device (e.g. smartphone) in a set of possible rooms.  The final aim is to playback an audio stream stored in a central server and move it from a speaker to an another, situated in every room, following person's movements.

\section{Introduction}
In 1994 L.M. Ericsson company began to be interested in wireless connection between cellular phones and other devices. With other four companies it formed a group, SIG, to develop a new standard wireless used to link computation and communication devices throught a wireless radio system with low costs, restricted power and range. The project was called Bluetooth and after five years it was published the first version 1.0 specific.
In figure \ref{stack} we can see the architecture of bluetooth protocol.

\label{stack}
\end{figure}

The protocols can be divided in four major classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Core protocols
\item Cable replacement protocols
\item Telephony control protocols
\item Adopted protocols
\end{itemize}

%-------TOFIX: a questo punto pesanvo di concertrare l'attenzione sul service discovery protocol usato per individuare le altre devices.e spiegare u pò come funzia


%The bluetooth protocol acts in 2.4Ghz frequency using 79 channels (between 2.402 and 2.480 Ghz) and the maximum transmission velocity is 2.1 Mbit/s (version 2.0). The devices can be divided in three classes according to power level and range.\\

\section{General architecture}
\subsection{Requirements}
The requirements for the correct functioning of the implemented application can be explained to follow.
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Smartphone:}} the device necessary to locate in which room the person is. We assume that there is only one smartphone to identify.  
\item{\textbf{Central server:}} it stores the main application and it controls all the communications from/to the BT adapter.
\end{itemize}
In every room there must be available:
\begin{itemize}
\item{a \textbf{bluetooth host adapter:}} it detects the bluetooth signal power, and trasmits throught a simple application the RSSI value to the central server; 
\item{a \textbf{speaker:}} it lets out sound when the associate BT adapter is selected for playback.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bluetooth module}
The main component of the project is the Bluetooth module, that manages the RSSI values and communications between hosts and server. It is based on a simple and very efficient application, named \texttt{Probe} and associated to every bleutooth adapter, that is able to interface with \textbf{bluez} throught \textbf{d-bus}. It takes charge of a discovery request and it keeps track of adapters available and their corresponding RSSI values.     

\subsection{Pulseaudio module}
In Pulseaudio we distinguish two particolar types of structures managed in our application.
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{pa\_sink}: it rapresents
\item \texttt{pa\_sink\_input}:
\end{itemize}
The idea concerns in redirecting the \texttt{pa\_sink\_input} coming from a specific application (e.g. MPlayer) to one or more \texttt{pa\_sink} associated with a speaker in every room.
By default the audio is reproduced by only one \texttt{pa\_sink}, but according to needs, it's possible to playback sound from more speakers simultaneously.
\subsection{Algorithm}
The algorithm implemented determines which speaker has to playback sound according to person's location; we can suppose infact that the signal power detected by the bluetooth adapter is higher than the other RSSI values in the room where person is situated. The following pseudo-code shows how the algorithm works. The output returned represents the index of speakers/rooms where the sound has to be reproduced.

Input variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Defer\_count}: time spent from inizialization to the request of available RSSI.
\item \textbf{Expiry\_time}: if this threshold is exceeded the playback is forced to start, even if there aren't all data available. 
\item \textbf{Current\_room}: location of the person in the current moment.
\item \textbf{No\_null\_RSSI}: number of available RSSI values.
\item \textbf{Adjacences\_map}: stores the adjacences between different rooms.
\item \textbf{RSSI\_map}: associates to every BT adapter the RSSI value detected.
\item \textbf{Min\_number\_RSSI}: min number of RSSI required to proceed with the sound playback. 
\item \textbf{Max\_number\_speakers}: max number of speakers that can be activated simultanously.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\underline{Choice algorithm:}}
\vspace{0.3cm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE $defer\_count \gets 0$
\STATE $current\_room \gets \mbox{Index room with max RSSI}$
\IF {($no\_null\_RSSI \leq min\_number\_RSSI$ \textbf{and} $defer\_count \leq expiry\_time)$} 
\STATE $defer\_count \gets defer\_count + 1$ 
\STATE $\texttt{goto 1)}$  
\ENDIF
%\STATE $Switch on no\_null\_RSSi value:$
\IF {$no\_null\_RSSI = 0$} \STATE $\texttt{pause}$ \ENDIF
\IF {$no\_null\_RSSI = 1$} \RETURN \mbox{Index room corresponding to} $no\_null\_RSSI$\ENDIF
\IF {$no\_null\_RSSI \geq 2$} \RETURN \mbox{(Index rooms corresponding} $no\_null\_RSSI)$ \mbox{\textbf{intersected with} (Index adjoining rooms to} $current\_room)$  \ENDIF
\STATE $\texttt{goto 1)}$
